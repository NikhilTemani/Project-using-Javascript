        Technology is the result of accumulated knowledge and application of skills, methods, and processes used in industrial production and scientific research. Technology is embedded in the operation of all machines, with or without detailed knowledge of their function, for the intended purpose of an organization. The technologies of society consist of what is known as systems. Systems operate by obtaining an input, altering this input through what is known as a process, and then producing an outcome that achieves the intended purpose of the system. This is also known as a technology system or technological system.    
        The earliest and simplest form of technology is the development of knowledge that leads to the application of basic tools. The prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools and the discovery of how to control fire increased the sources of food that were available to human beings through cooking procedures that eliminated almost all disease-causing pathogens in food sources. The subsequent Neolithic Revolution quadrupled the sustenance available from a usable territory through the development of farming technologies. <br><br>
        The invention of the wheel led to the travelling technologies that helped humans not only further increase the yield of food production over a given period, but also travel between and across territories in less time, where information could be more easily exchanged between members of society. Not only did this circumstance result in an increased total of food production and increased information exchange over large territories, but also the increased production of raw materials, such as spinning thread or yarn, through the invention of the spinning wheel. Since these raw materials can be processed into paper, the opportunity to provide information to a larger population had also become available during this period in history. <br><br>
        While technological advances have helped economies develop and create the rise of a leisure class, many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and the depletion of natural resources from the Earth's environment. As a consequence, philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology and whether technology improves or worsens the human condition. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology by stating that technology harms the environment and destroys human relationships. While this is the case, ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. <br><br>
        While innovations have always influenced the values of a society and have raised new questions in the ethics of technology, the advancement of technology itself has also led to the pursuit of new solutions for the previously discussed concerns of technological advancement. For example, upcoming technology involves renewable resources being used in transportation, allowing humans to travel in space, for technology itself to become more affordable and reliable, and for increased automation.
